# SymCompta

**SymCompta** is a prototype developed to improve my knowledge of Symfony, API and React.js.

It is based on the guideline of an excellent Lior Chamla course and I add the functionality I need.

It will only be used for my own accounting as belgian freelance but when it is finished you will have the possibility to test.

Possible options should be:

- Inscription,
- Authentication,
- Consult, add and modify customers, suppliers, invoices and VAT declaration,
- Calculation of amounts and VAT.

### Why _SymCompta_ ?

"_Sym_" is a diminutive of **Symfony** but also my trigram (**SY**lvana **M**élens) and "_Compta_" is the diminutive of "comptabilité" in french which means "accounting".
